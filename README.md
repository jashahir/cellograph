# Cellograph

Cellograph is a graph neural network model that uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data (but can extended to other single-cell modalities). You can read more about it in our preprint on bioRxiv: [Shahir et al, 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.24.528672v1).

You can install using `pip install cellograph`

To learn how to implement Cellograph, take a look at our tutorial [here](https://github.com/jashahir/cellograph/blob/main/CellographHumanOrganoid.ipynb).
