# Cellograph

Cellograph is a graph neural network model that uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data (but can extended to other single-cell modalities). More details can be found in [Shahir et al, 2023].

To learn how to implement Cellograph, take a look at our tutorial here.
